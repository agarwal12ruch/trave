        <p class="ruch4">Named after an Elephant like stone at its foot, the Elephant Falls are amongst the most popular
            falls in the North-East, situated next to Shillong. It is a tourists' paradise with three layers of the
            falls accessible to the layman from different vantage points.
            The breathtaking Elephant falls were referred to as 'Ka Kshaid Lai Pateng Khohsiew' by the local Khasi
            people, which means 'The Three Step Waterfalls', as these falls consist of three mesmerising falls in
            succession.Out of the three, the third waterfall tends to strike the visitors as the most impressive.
            Elephant Falls is a great stopover destination before one heads for further journeys into Meghalaya. Located
            12 km away from the capital city of Shillong, it is one of the most visited falls in the beautiful state.
